### What Are Objects For?

Objects provide us with a way to represent real-world or virtual things. We can do this by storing information inside the object's properties.

### Properties

Properties are like **variables** that belong to an object, and are used to hold pieces of information. 
Properties can be accessed in two ways:

* Dot notation, with `ObjectName.PropertyName`
* Bracket notation, with `ObjectName["PropertyName"] ` (don't forget the quotes!)

### Customizing Constructors

- We can assign our objects properties through parameters we pass in when the object is created.
- We can give our objects methods automatically.

### Methods

Methods are like **functions** that are associated with a particular object.
They are especially helpful when you want to either:
- Update the object properties
- Calculate something based on an object's properties.
